\title{Inhibiting the parallelism in P systems}
\author{Michal Kováč}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
P systems are formal models of distributed parallel multiset processing. Many variants make use of the maximal parallelism to achieve universality.
It is known that P systems with catalytic rules with only one catalyst are not universal, but when using promoters and inhibitors, the universality is achieved.
The sequential variant of P system is also not universal and we will show how the computational universality can be reached by using sequential P systems with inhibitors. Both accepting and generating case are investigated.
In addition, a new variant of P system is defined in this paper, where the emptiness of a region is represented by a special vacuum object. This variant is shown to be universal when operating in the sequential mode.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% Bio motivation

Membrane systems (P systems) were introduced by P\u{a}un (see \cite{Paun2000108}) as distributed parallel computing devices inspired by the structure and functionality of cells.
One of the objectives is to relax the condition of using the rules in a maximally parallel way in order to find more realistic P systems from a biological point of view.
In sequential systems, only one rewriting rule is used in each step of computation.

% Our work

We are looking for ways to obtain universality in this sequential mode.

% Inhibitors

At first, we consider inhibitors and show that using them we can simulate P system working in a maximally parallel way.

% Vacuum

Then, we introduce the concept of vacuum. In the common sense, vacuum represents a state of space with no or a little matter in it. Using vacuum in modelling frameworks can help express certain phenomena more easily.
We define a new P system variant, which creates a special vacuum object in a region as soon as the region becomes empty. The vacuum is removed whenever some object interacts with it. After the interaction, there is vacuum no longer. This removal process is realized by allowing the vacuum object to be used only on the left side of rules.
If we made the vacuum to be removed automatically when an object enters the region, there would be no difference with the variant without vacuum objects because of no interactions with it.
We are interested in how the variant with the vacuum improves the computational power of a P system in comparison to the variant without the vacuum.


% Related work

There have been lot of research that consider rewriting rules with catalysts, promoters and inhibitors. However, they were only used to overcome the limitations brought by non-cooperative rules, and still working in a maximal parallel manner.

% Max 1 instance of any rule

In \cite{Ibarra04dang} they have a variant of P systems with maximal parallelism restricted to use at most one instance of any rule in a step.
They show that for universality is sufficient non-cooperative variant where the only allowed cooperative rule with both symbols equal. For example rule $a|a\rightarrow b$. Also, catalytic rules are sufficient too.

% Cooperative vs Context free

In \cite{Sburlan05dragos} the author formally proves equality between classes of P systems and Parikh images of classes in Chomsky hierarchy. P systems with context-free rules are equal to $PsCF$ and P systems with cooperative rules are universal (equal to $PsRE$).

% Two catalysts are enough
% One catalyst with promoters / inhibitors is enough

The gap between is filled in \cite{Ionescu:jucs_10_5:on_p_systems_with}. Assumed P systems with context-free rules and maximal parallelism, there is a need for some context added to the rules. Cooperative or catalytic rules are sufficient for universality. The paper shows that two catalyst are enough. There was an open question whether one catalyst is enough. Then it was shown that it is not enough unless we allow promoters or inhibitors. Without them it has the power of Lindenmayer systems.

% Inhibiting rules

Rewriting controlled by inhibition is more thoroughly researched in \cite{Cavaliere:2004:IRP:2144633.2144648}. P systems with context-free rules and are enriched with rules with option to inhibit / de-inhibit another rule. This, with one catalyst is shown to be universal. Without catalyst and with only one membrane it is shown to have at least the power of Lindenmayer systems.

% Context free with inhibitors

However, \cite{doi:10.1142/S0129054106003772} shows that even if we have maximal parallel context-free rules with inhibitors, it is only equal to the family of Parikh sets of ET0L languages (PsET0L). If we have promoters instead of inhibitors, only the inclusion of the family PsET0L was proved. % it is stronger than PsET0L

% Sequential with energies and priorities

Several sequential variants of P systems were studied. In \cite{Freund:2004:SPS:2149813.2149831} membranes have been assigned energy values that can control rule rewriting. Each rule has energy that is consumed when the rule is applied. If we have rules with priorities, the system becomes universal.

% Sequential not universal

However, if we extend sequential P systems with cooperative rules as in \cite{Dang04onp} and restrict it to use only one membrane, it defines exactly semilinear sets and is not universal.

There is something fundamental that prevents the sequential systems to be universal. Unlike maximal parallel systems, the application of rules in sequential systems are not synchronized between membranes. Even inside one membrane an object can be rewritten multiple times while other objects are not rewritten at all.
Maximal parallelism does not suffer from these issues.

There is also a notion of minimal parallelism (\cite{Ciobanu:2007:PSM:1243519.1243811}), which forces all membranes to apply at least one rule if there is one that can be used. This approach solves the synchronization issue between membranes, but not the one inside one membrane. Nevertheless, P systems with minimal parallelism are universal.



% Deterministic, asynchronous context-free with inhibitors not universal

In \cite{Alhazov13} several non-cooperative variants with either promoters or inhibitors were studied. Maximally parallel and asynchronous modes was shown to be universal. They also defined the deterministic mode (only for accepting case). The computation is accepted only if for each configuration there was at most one multiset of rules applicable. Such deterministic variant was shown to only accept the family of all finite languages.

% CLS

Another sequential model, but not a variant of P system, is Calculi of Looping Sequences. It is introduced in \cite{Barbuti07thecalculus} as a membrane model where objects are strings that can loop around forming a membrane. Rewriting rules are global and are executed sequentially. It is shown to be universal by directly simulating P systems.


In section~\ref{sec:preliminaries} we recall some fundamental notions which we will use through the rest of the paper.
We introduce the notion of P system and define a computation of a P system in section~\ref{sec:p-systems}.
Some existing P system variants are mentioned in section~\ref{sec:variants}. There is also introduced our new variant of P system with vacuum.
In section~\ref{sec:inhibitors} we make a proof that sequential P systems with inhibitors are universal.
Similar result, but for our new variant of P system with vacuum is achieved and proven in section~\ref{sec:vacuum}.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

Here we recall several notions from the classical theory of formal languages.

An {\bf alphabet} is a finite nonempty set of symbols. Usually it is denoted by $\Sigma$ or $V$. A {\bf string} over an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from alphabet. We denote by $V^*$ the set of all strings over an alphabet $V$. By $V^+$ = $V^* - \{\eps\}$ we denote the set of all nonempty strings over V. A {\bf language} over the alphabet $V$ is any subset of $V^*$.

The number of occurrences of a given symbol $a\in V$ in the string $w\in V^*$ is denoted by $|w|_a$. $\Psi_V(w)=(|w|_{a_1},|w|_{a_2},\dots,|w|_{a_n})$ is called a Parikh vector associated with the string $w\in V^*$, where $V=\{a_1,a_2,\dots a_n\}$. For a language $L\subseteq V^*$, $\Psi_V(L)=\{\Psi_V(w)|w\in L\}$ is the Parikh mapping associated with $V$. If FL is a family of languages, by PsFL is denoted the family of Parikh images of languages in FL.

A multiset over a set $X$ is a mapping $M: X\rightarrow \mathbb N$. We denote by $M(x), x\in X$ the multiplicity of $x$ in the multiset $M$. The {\bf support} of a multiset $M$ is the set $supp(M)=\{x\in X|M(x)\geq 1\}$. It is the set of items with at least one occurrence. A multiset is {\bf empty} when it's support is empty. A multiset $M$ with finite support $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ can be represented by the string $x_1^{M(x_1)}x_2^{M(x_2)}\dots x_n^{M(x_n)}$. We say that multiset $M_1$ is included in multiset $M_2$ if $M_1(x)\leq M_2(x)\forall x \in X$. We denote it by $M_1\subseteq M_2$. The {\bf union} of two multisets $M_1\cup M_2 : X\rightarrow \mathbb N$ is defined as $(M_1\cup M_2)(x)=M_1(x)+M_2(x)$. The {\bf difference} of two multisets $M_1-M_2 : X\rightarrow \mathbb N$ is defined as $(M_1-M_2)(x)=M_1(x)-M_2(x)$. Product of multiset $M$ with natural number $n\in \mathbb N$ is $(n\cdot M)(x)=n\cdot M(x)$.

% Membrane structure

The fundamental ingredient of a P system is the {\bf membrane structure} (see \cite{Paun2006Introduction}). It is a hierarchically arranged set of membranes, all contained in the {\bf skin membrane}. A membrane without any other membrane inside is said to be {\bf elementary}. Each membrane determines a compartment, also called region, the space delimited from above by it and from below by the membranes placed directly inside, if any exists. Clearly, the correspondence membrane – region is one-to-one, that is why we sometimes use interchangeably these terms.

% Maximal parallelism

Consider a finite set of symbols $V=\{a_1, a_2,\dots, a_n\}$. An arbitrary multiset rewriting rule is a pair $(u, v)$ of multisets over the set $V$ where $u$ is not empty. Such a rule is typically written as $u\rightarrow v$. For a multiset rewriting rule $r : u\rightarrow v$, let $left(r) = u$ and $right(r) = v$. Let $w$ be a multiset of symbols over $V$ and let $R=\{r_1, r_2,\dots, r_k\}$ be a set of multiset rewriting rules such that $r_i = u_i\rightarrow v_i$ with $u_i, v_i$ multisets over $V$. Denote by $R^{ap}_w\subseteq R$ the {\bf set of applicable multiset rewriting rules} to $w$, that is, $R^{ap}_w = \{r\in R|left(r)\subseteq w\}$. Denote by $R^{msap}_w: R\rightarrow \mathbb N$, a multiset over $R$ of {\bf maximal simultaneously applicable multiset rewriting rules} to $w$. $R^{msap}_w$ is any multiset such that $\displaystyle\bigcup_{r\in R} R^{msap}_w(r)\cdot left(r)\subseteq w$ and $\forall r' \left(\displaystyle\bigcup_{r\in R} R^{msap}_w(r)\cdot left(r)\right)\cup left(r')\nsubseteq w$. In other words, we use a multiset of rewriting rules such that no more rules can be applied simultaneously.

% P system

\input{p-system-definition}
  
Each rewriting rule may specify for each symbol on the right side, whether it stays in the current region, moves through the membrane to the parent region or through membrane to one of the child regions. An example of such rule is the following: $abb\rightarrow (a,here)(b,in)(c,out)(c,here)$.

\section{P system variants}
\label{sec:variants}

There are several variants of P systems. They varies in the definition of the rewriting process.

We study the power of new P system variants. Those with the power of the Turing machine are especially interesting, they are said to be computationally universal. Computational power for a model is usually proved by proving equivalence to other model with known power. The equivalence is usually proved through the simulation of a step of the computation.

{\bf Sequential P systems} are variant where in each step only a single rule in a single region is applied. The membrane and the rule are chosen nondeterministically. In \cite{Ibarra:2005:SPS:2111772.2111880} it is shown that the sequential P systems can be simulated by vector addition systems are are not universal. However, if we allow rules with membrane creation with unbounded number of mebranes, they become universal.
{\bf Cooperative P systems} have rules that have at most two symbols on the left side.
{\bf Context-free P systems} have only rules that have only one symbol on the left side.
{\bf Catalytic P systems} have catalysts as a specific subset of alphabet. There are two types of rules:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ca\rightarrow cw$, where $c$ is catalyst,
	\item $a\rightarrow w$
\end{enumerate}

An object $a$ can be a {\bf promoter} (see \cite{Ionescu:jucs_10_5:on_p_systems_with}) for a rule $u\rightarrow v$, and we denote this by $u\rightarrow v|_a$, if the rule is active only in the presence of object $a$ in the same region. An object $b$ is {\bf inhibitor} for a rule $u\rightarrow v$, and we denote this by $u\rightarrow v|_{\neg b}$, if the rule is active only if the inhibitor $b$ is not present in the region.
The difference between catalysts and promoters consists in the fact that the catalysts directly participate in rules, but are not modified by them, and they are counted as any other objects, so that the number of applications of a rule is as big as the number of copies of the catalyst, while in the case of promoters, the presence of the promoter objects makes it possible to use the associated rule as many times as possible, without any restriction; moreover, the promoting objects do not necessarily directly participate in the rules. As a consequence, one can notice that the catalysts inhibits the parallelism of the system while the promoters / inhibitors only guide the computation process.

\vspace*{\baselineskip}

We propose a new variant: {\bf P system with vacuum}. The notion of vacuum is new in context of P systems.

From the physical point of view, vacuum is space that is empty of matter. We will consider vacuum as state of a P system region with no objects that are defined in the P system. There still can be some other object present which are not of interest such as air, water, cytoplasm and which do not react with objects of P system.

We will allow vacuum to act as a reactant in reactions. But there is a problem: when there is a vacuum in a region, there is no other object to react with. So what does the reaction with vacuum mean?

The reaction can be also seen as ``object entering the vacuum'' - objects are facing low pressure and are sucked into the region. So when some object enters the region with the vacuum, the vacuum is not removed immediately. We will represent this behavior with rewriting rules that can have vacuum on the left side of the rule. The vacuum cannot be on the right side of a rule. It is created automatically when the region becomes empty.

From certain point of view, vacuum can be seen as a sort of inhibitor. For example food is often packed in vacuum packing in order to delay / inhibit food decay.

\section{Trading maximal parallelism for inhibitor usage}
\label{sec:inhibitors}
The goal of this paper is to show that using inhibitors, the sequential P systems can achieve universality like maximal parallel variant. The proof is partially inspired by \cite{Barbuti07thecalculus}, where it is shown that Calculi of Looping Sequences (CLS) can simulate computation of a P system. CLS is a membrane model with string objects and sequential rules.

\subsection{Inhibitor set}
Original definition of P system with inhibitor (see \cite{Ionescu:jucs_10_5:on_p_systems_with}) have only a single inhibitor object per rule. P system with inhibitor set can have rules of type $u\rightarrow v|_{\neg B}$, where $B\subseteq V$. The rule $u\rightarrow v$ is active only if there is no occurrence of any symbol from $B$.

Lemma \ref{lemma:inhibitor_step} will establish equivalence of these two definitions of rewriting rule when special precondition is fulfilled - there is no empty region.

\subsection{Register machines} % (fold)
\label{sub:register_machines}
  We will use in our paper the power of Minsky's register machine \cite{Ionescu:jucs_10_5:on_p_systems_with}, that is why we recall here this notion. Such a machine runs a program consisting of numbered instructions of several simple types. Several variants of register machines with different number of registers and different instructions sets were shown to be computationally universal (see \cite{Ibarra:2005:SPS:2111772.2111880} for some original definitions and \cite{Khrisna03threeuniversality} for the definition used in this paper).

\subsection{Accepting vs generating} % (fold)
\label{sub:accepting_vs_generating}
  According to \cite{Barbuti:2010:MSW:1946067.1946081}, a P system can be used either as an acceptor or as a generator of a multiset language over $\Sigma$. In the first case, a multiset over $\Sigma$ is inserted in the skin membrane of the P system and the result of its computations says whether such a multiset belongs to the multiset language accepted by the P system or not. In the second case the P system has a fixed initial configuration and can give as results (possibly in a non-deterministic way) all the possible multisets belonging to a given multiset language.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have studied several variants of sequential P systems in order to obtain universality without using maximal parallelism.
A variant with rewriting rules that can use inhibitors was shown to be universal in both generating and accepting case. The generating model is able to simulate maximal parallel P system and the accepting model can simulate a register machine.

In addition, we have defined a new notion of vacuum, which is immediately created in the region that becomes empty. A new P system variant was introduced, which allowed the vacuum to be used on the left side of P system rewriting rules. The accepting case of this variant was shown to be universal by direct implementation of a register machine.

A lot of other variants deserve to be combined with the vacuum, so we suggest to research them more thoroughly(non-cooperative rules, rules with priorities, decaying objects, deterministic steps, \dots).
