{\bf Computation} of a P system consists of a sequence of steps. The step $S_i$ is appied to result of previous step $S_{i-1}$. So when $S_i = (C_j,C_{j+1})$, $S_{i-1} = (C_{j-1},C_j)$.

Result of computation is multiset of symbols that left the skin membrane in the configuration after the last computation step. For one initial configuration there can be multiple possible results. It follows from the fact that there exist more than one maximal multiset of rules that can be applied in each step.

P system defines a parikh image of a language: the set of possible results of computations.
