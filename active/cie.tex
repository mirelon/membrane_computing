\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% Bio motivation

Membrane systems (P systems) were introduced by P\u{a}un (see \cite{Paun2000108}) as distributed parallel computing devices inspired by the structure and functionality of cells.
One of the objectives is to relax the condition of using the rules in a maximally parallel way in order to find more realistic P systems from a biological point of view.
In sequential systems, only one rewriting rule is used in each step of computation.


\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

Here we recall several notions from the classical theory of formal languages.

An {\bf alphabet} is a finite nonempty set of symbols. Usually it is denoted by $\Sigma$. A {\bf string} over an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from alphabet. We denote by $\Sigma^*$ the set of all strings over an alphabet $\Sigma$. By $\Sigma^+$ = $\Sigma^* - \{\eps\}$ we denote the set of all nonempty strings over $\Sigma$. A {\bf language} over the alphabet $\Sigma$ is any subset of $\Sigma^*$.

The number of occurrences of a given symbol $a\in \Sigma$ in the string $w\in \Sigma^*$ is denoted by $|w|_a$. $\Psi_\Sigma(w)=(|w|_{a_1},|w|_{a_2},\dots,|w|_{a_n})$ is called a Parikh vector associated with the string $w\in \Sigma^*$, where $\Sigma=\{a_1,a_2,\dots a_n\}$. For a language $L\subseteq \Sigma^*$, $\Psi_\Sigma(L)=\{\Psi_\Sigma(w)|w\in L\}$ is the Parikh mapping associated with $L$. If FL is a family of languages, PsFL is denoted the family of Parikh images of languages in FL.

A multiset over a set $\Sigma$ is a mapping $M: \Sigma\rightarrow \mathbb N$.
We denote by $M(a), a\in \Sigma$ the multiplicity of $a$ in the multiset $M$.
The {\bf support} of a multiset $M$ is the set $supp(M)=\{a\in \Sigma|M(a)\geq 1\}$.
It is the set of items with at least one occurrence.
A multiset is {\bf empty} when its support is empty.
A multiset $M$ with finite support $\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$ can be represented by the string $a_1^{M(a_1)}a_2^{M(a_2)}\dots a_n^{M(a_n)}$.
We say that multiset $M_1$ is included in multiset $M_2$ if $\forall a \in supp(M_1): M_1(a)\leq M_2(a)$.
We denote it by $M_1\subseteq M_2$.
If $M_1\subseteq M_2$, the {\bf difference} of two multisets $M_2-M_1$ is defined as a multiset where $\forall a \in supp(M_2): (M_2-M_1)(a)=\max(M_2(a)-M_1(a),0)$.
The {\bf union} of two multisets $M_1\cup M_2$ is a multiset where $\forall a \in supp(M_1)\cup supp(M_2): (M_1\cup M_2)(a)=M_1(a)+M_2(a)$.
The product of multiset $M$ with natural number $n\in \mathbb N$ is a multiset where $\forall a \in supp(M): (n\cdot M)(a)=n\cdot M(a)$.

Next, we recall notions from graph theory.

A {\bf rooted tree} is a tree, in which a particular node is distinguished from the others and called the root node.
Let $T$ be a rooted tree. We will denote its root node by $r_T$.
Let $d$ be a node of $T\setminus\{r_T\}$. The node adjacent to $d$ on the only path from $d$ to $r_T$ is called a {\bf parent node} of $d$ and is denoted by $parent_T(d)$.
We will denote the set of nodes of $T$ by $V(T)$ and set of its edges by $E(T)$.
Let $T_1, T_2$ be rooted trees. A bijection $f: V(T_1)\rightarrow V(T_2)$ is an {\bf isomorphism} iff $\{(f(u),f(v))|(u,v)\in E(V(T_1))\} = E(V(T_2))$ and $f(r_{T_1}) = r_{T_2}$. 

  
\section{Active P systems}
\label{sec:p systems}

% Membrane structure

The fundamental ingredient of a P system is the {\bf membrane structure} (see \cite{Paun2006Introduction}). It is a hierarchically arranged set of membranes, all contained in the {\bf skin membrane}. Each membrane determines a compartment, also called region, which is the space delimited from above by it and from below by the membranes placed directly inside, if any exists. Clearly, the correspondence membrane – region is one-to-one, that is why we sometimes use interchangeably these terms.
Membrane structure can be also viewed as a rooted tree with the skin membrane as the root node.

\subsection{Register machines} % (fold)
\label{sub:register_machines}
  As a referential universal language acceptor we will use Minsky's register machine. Such a machine runs a program consisting of numbered instructions of several simple types.

\section{Termination problems} % (fold)
\label{sec:termination_problems}

In this section we recall the halting problem for Turing machines. The problem is to determine, given a deterministic Turing machine and an input, whether the machine running on that input will halt. It is one of the first known undecidable problems. On the other hand, for non-deterministic machines, there are two possible meanings for halting. We could be interested either in:
\begin{itemize}
  \item whether there exists an infinite computation (the machine can run forever), or
  \item whether there exists a finite computation (the machine can halt)
\end{itemize}

We will prove the (un)decidability of these problems on active P systems with limit on total number of membranes. The results are quite interesting, because:

\begin{theorem}
  Active P systems with limit on total number of membranes are universal.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The proof of this theorem for active P system in \cite{Ibarra05Active} uses simulation of register machines and during the simulation, every configuration has at most three membranes, hence the universality holds also for active P systems with limit on total number of membranes.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Existence of infinite computation} % (fold)
\label{sub:existence_of_infinite_computation}

We will propose an algorithm for deciding existence of infinite computation. Basic idea is to consider the minimal coverability graph (\cite{Rozenberg93MinimalCoverabilityGraph}), where nodes are configurations and edge leads from the configuration $C_1$ to the configuration $C_2$, whenever there is a rule applicable in $C_1$, which results in $C_2$. The construction in \cite{Rozenberg93MinimalCoverabilityGraph} is performed on Petri nets, where the configuration consists just of a vector of natural numbers. The situation is the same for single-membrane sequential P systems. We need to modify the construction for active P systems.

A configuration $C_2 = (T_2, l_2, c_2)$ {\bf covers} configuration $C_1 = (T_1, l_1, c_1)$ iff $\exists$ isomorphism $f: T_1\rightarrow T_2$ such that $\forall d\in T_1$ the following properties hold: $l_1(d)=l_2(f(d))\wedge c_1(d)\subseteq c_2(f(d))$.

We will denote this with $C_1\leq C_2$.

% TODO state the rule applicability lemma
\begin{lemma}
  If $C_2 = (T_2, l_2, c_2)$ {\bf covers} configuration $C_1 = (T_1, l_1, c_1)$, then there is an isomorphism $f: T_1\rightarrow T_2$ such that if a rule $r$ is applicable in membrane $d\in T_1$, then $r$ is applicable in $f(d)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $r$ is applicable in $d$. Then left side of the rule is contained within the contents of the membrane $u\subseteq c_1(d)$. Because $C_1\leq C_2$, then $c_1(d)\subseteq c_2(f(d))$ and then $u\subseteq c_2(f(d))$.

  There are three possible forms of the rule $r$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $r = u\rightarrow w$, then because $r$ is applicable in $d$, $\forall (a,\downarrow_k)\in w \exists d_2\in V(T_1): l_1(d_2)=k \wedge parent_{T_1}(d_2) = d$. Because $C_1\leq C_2$, then for $f(d_2)\in V(T_2)$ the following holds: $l_2(f(d_2)) = l_1(d_2) = k$ and $parent_{T_2}(f(d_2) = f(d)$. Hence $r$ is applicable in $f(d)$.
    \item If $r = u\rightarrow w\delta$, then $d\neq r_{T_1}$. Because $f$ is an isomorphism, then also $f(d)\neq r_{T_2}$. Other properties follows from the previous case.
    \item If $r = u\rightarrow [_k v]_k$, then $|V(T_1)|<L$. Isomorphism preserves number of nodes, hence $|V(T_2)| = |V(T_1)| < L$ and $r$ is applicable in $f(d)$. \qed
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  Existence of infinite computation for active P systems with limit on total number of membranes is decidable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  From Dickson's lemma [citation needed] or from Karp-Miller reachability theorem [citation needed] implies that for a every inifite sequence of configurations there are two such that one covers the other.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Existence of finite computation} % (fold)
\label{sub:existence_of_finite_computation}

\begin{theorem}
  Existence of finite computation for active P systems with limit on total number of membranes is undecidable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Either reduce it to detection of empty language or to reachability.
