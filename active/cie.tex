\begin{abstract}
We study variants of P systems that are working in the sequential mode. Basically, they are not computationally universal, but there are possible extensions that can increase the computation power. Extensions that implement a notion of zero-checking, are often computationally universal.
P systems with an ability to create new membranes are a rare exception as they are known to be computationally universal even in the sequential mode without using a dedicated zero-check operation.
In this paper we show a result that seems surprising to us - the existence of an infinite computation for sequential P systems with active membranes is decidable. The standard construction of coverability tree is extended to provide an algorithm for detecting infinite loops.
In addition, we show that the existence of a halting computation is undecidable as it can be reduced to reachability of register machines.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% Bio motivation

Membrane systems (P systems) \cite{Paun10OxfordHandbookMembraneComputing} were introduced by P\u{a}un (see \cite{Paun2000108}) as distributed parallel computing devices inspired by the structure and functionality of cells. Starting from the observation that there is an obvious parallelism in the cell biochemistry and relying on the assumption that ``if we wait enough, then all reactions which may take place will take place'', a feature of the P systems is given by the maximal parallel way of using the rules. For various reasons ranging from looking for more realistic models to just more mathematical challenge, the maximal parallelism was questioned, either simply criticized, or replaced with presumably less restrictive assumptions.
In some cases, a sequential model may be a more reasonable assumption. In sequential P systems, only one rewriting rule is used in each step of computation. Without priorities, they are equivalent to Petri nets \cite{Ibarra05Active}, hence not computationally universal. However priorities, inhibitors and other modifications can increase the computation power. It seems that there is a link between universality and ability to zero-check \cite{Alhazov12Properties}.

In this paper we study a variant where universality can be achieved without checking for zero by allowing membranes to be created unlimited number of times \cite{Ibarra05Active}. Such P systems are called active P systems. Contrary, if we place a limit on the number of times a membrane is created, we get a class of P systems which is only equivalent to Petri nets, hence not computationally universal.

In Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} we will recall some basic notions from formal languages, multisets and graph theory. Then in Section \ref{sec:p systems} we will introduce membrane structure and formally define membrane configuration and active P system, because standard definitions are not convenient for our formal proofs.

Section \ref{sec:termination_problems} contains two main results. The existence of an infinite computation is surprisingly shown to be decidable.
On the other hand, the existence of a halting computation is shown to be undecidable.


\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

Here we recall several notions from the classical theory of formal languages.

An {\bf alphabet} is a finite nonempty set of symbols. Usually it is denoted by $\Sigma$. A {\bf string} over an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet. We denote by $\Sigma^*$ the set of all strings over an alphabet $\Sigma$. By $\Sigma^+$ = $\Sigma^* - \{\eps\}$ we denote the set of all nonempty strings over $\Sigma$. A {\bf language} over the alphabet $\Sigma$ is any subset of $\Sigma^*$.

The number of occurrences of a given symbol $a\in \Sigma$ in the string $w\in \Sigma^*$ is denoted by $|w|_a$. $\Psi_\Sigma(w)=(|w|_{a_1},|w|_{a_2},\dots,|w|_{a_n})$ is called a Parikh vector associated with the string $w\in \Sigma^*$, where $\Sigma=\{a_1,a_2,\dots, a_n\}$. For a language $L\subseteq \Sigma^*$, $\Psi_\Sigma(L)=\{\Psi_\Sigma(w)|w\in L\}$ is the Parikh image of $L$. If FL is a family of languages, PsFL denotes the family of Parikh images of languages in FL.

A multiset over a set $\Sigma$ is a mapping $M: \Sigma\rightarrow \mathbb N$.
We denote by $M(a), a\in \Sigma$ the multiplicity of $a$ in the multiset $M$.
The {\bf support} of a multiset $M$ is the set $supp(M)=\{a\in \Sigma|M(a)\geq 1\}$.
It is the set of items with at least one occurrence.
A multiset is {\bf empty} when its support is empty.
A multiset $M$ with finite support $\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$ can be represented by the string $a_1^{M(a_1)}a_2^{M(a_2)}\dots a_n^{M(a_n)}$.
We say that multiset $M_1$ is included in multiset $M_2$ if $\forall a \in supp(M_1): M_1(a)\leq M_2(a)$.
We denote it by $M_1\subseteq M_2$.
The {\bf difference} of two multisets $M_2-M_1$ is defined as a multiset where $\forall a \in supp(M_2): (M_2-M_1)(a)=\max(M_2(a)-M_1(a),0)$.
The {\bf union} of two multisets $M_1\cup M_2$ is a multiset where $\forall a \in supp(M_1)\cup supp(M_2): (M_1\cup M_2)(a)=M_1(a)+M_2(a)$.
The product of multiset $M$ with natural number $n\in \mathbb N$ is a multiset where $\forall a \in supp(M): (n\cdot M)(a)=n\cdot M(a)$.

Next, we recall notions from graph theory.

A {\bf rooted tree} is a tree, in which a particular node is distinguished from the others and called the root node.
Let $T$ be a rooted tree. We will denote its root node by $r_T$.
Let $d$ be a node of $T\setminus\{r_T\}$.
As $T$ is a tree, there is a unique path from $d$ to $r_T$. 
The node adjacent to $d$ on that path is also unique and is called a {\bf parent node} of $d$ and is denoted by $parent_T(d)$.
We will denote the set of nodes of $T$ by $V(T)$ and set of its edges by $E(T)$.
Let $T_1, T_2$ be rooted trees. A bijection $f: V(T_1)\rightarrow V(T_2)$ is an {\bf isomorphism} iff $\{(f(u),f(v))|(u,v)\in E(T_1)\} = E(T_2)$ and $f(r_{T_1}) = r_{T_2}$. 

  
\section{Active P systems}
\label{sec:p systems}

% Membrane structure

The fundamental ingredient of a P system is the {\bf membrane structure} (see \cite{Paun2006Introduction}). It is a hierarchically arranged set of membranes, all contained in the {\bf skin membrane}. Each membrane determines a compartment, also called region, which is the space delimited from above by it and from below by the membranes placed directly inside, if any exists. Clearly, the correspondence membrane – region is one-to-one, that is why we sometimes use interchangeably these terms.
The membrane structure can be also viewed as a rooted tree with the skin membrane as the root node.

A P system consists of a membrane structure, where each membrane is labeled with a number from 1 to $m$. Each membrane contains a multiset of objects. Objects can be transformed into other objects and sent through a membrane according to given rules defined for membrane labels. The rules are known from the beginning for each possible membrane, even for the ones that do not exist yet, or the ones that will never exist.

In this paper we work with P systems with active membranes (Active P systems). The rules can modify the membrane structure by dissolving and creating new membranes. That is why we will define the configuration to include the membrane structure as well.

\section{Termination problems} % (fold)
\label{sec:termination_problems}

In this section we recall the halting problem for Turing machines. The problem is to determine, given a deterministic Turing machine and an input, whether the Turing machine running on that input will halt. It is one of the first known undecidable problems. On the other hand, for non-deterministic machines, there are two possible meanings for halting. We could be interested either in:
\begin{itemize}
  \item whether there exists an infinite computation (the machine can run forever), or
  \item whether there exists a finite computation (the machine can halt).
\end{itemize}

We will prove the (un)decidability of these problems on active P systems with limit on the total number of membranes. These problems are defined for both generating and accepting mode, but in the accepting mode we consider the questions for a given P system along with the input multiset. The results are quite interesting, because:

\begin{theorem}
  Sequential active P systems with limit on the total number of membranes are computationally universal.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The proof of this theorem for sequential active P systems in \cite{Ibarra05Active} uses simulation of register machines and during the simulation, every configuration has at most three membranes. Hence the active P system with limit on the total number of membranes exists (e.g. with $L=3$), so the universality holds.
  \qed
\end{proof}

This variant is not very realistic from biological point of view. Assuming membranes to know the number of membranes in the whole system is simply not plausible. Although we believe the results also hold for the variant without limit on the total number of membranes, due to technical difficulties it remains an open problem.

\subsection{Existence of infinite computation} % (fold)
\label{sub:existence_of_infinite_computation}

We will propose an algorithm for deciding existence of infinite computation. Basic idea is to consider the minimal coverability graph (\cite{Rozenberg93MinimalCoverabilityGraph}), where nodes are configurations and an edge leads from the configuration $C_1$ to the configuration $C_2$, whenever there is a rule applicable in $C_1$, which results in $C_2$. The construction in \cite{Rozenberg93MinimalCoverabilityGraph} is performed on Petri nets, where the configuration consists just of a vector of natural numbers. The situation is the same for single-membrane sequential P systems \cite{Dal-Zilio03Dynamics}. We need to modify the construction for active P systems.

A configuration $C_2 = (T_2, l_2, c_2)$ {\bf covers} configuration $C_1 = (T_1, l_1, c_1)$ iff $\exists$ isomorphism $f: T_1\rightarrow T_2$ preserving membrane labels and contents: $\forall d\in T_1$ the following properties hold: $l_1(d)=l_2(f(d))\wedge c_1(d)\subseteq c_2(f(d))$.

We will denote this with $C_1\leq C_2$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{rule_applicability_lemma}
  For sequential active P system with limit on the total number of membranes, if $C_2 = (T_2, l_2, c_2)$ {\bf covers} configuration $C_1 = (T_1, l_1, c_1)$, then there is an isomorphism $f: T_1\rightarrow T_2$ such that if a rule $r$ is applicable in membrane $d\in T_1$, then $r$ is applicable in $f(d)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $r$ is applicable in $d$. Then the left side $u$ of the rule $r$ is contained within the contents of the membrane $u\subseteq c_1(d)$. Because $C_1\leq C_2$, then there is an isomorphism $f:T_1\rightarrow T_2$ such that $c_1(d)\subseteq c_2(f(d))$ and then $u\subseteq c_2(f(d))$.

  There are three possible forms of the rule $r$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $r = u\rightarrow w$, then because $r$ is applicable in $d$, $\forall (a,\downarrow_k)\in w \exists d_2\in V(T_1): l_1(d_2)=k \wedge parent_{T_1}(d_2) = d$. Because $C_1\leq C_2$, then for $f(d_2)\in V(T_2)$ the following holds: $l_2(f(d_2)) = l_1(d_2) = k$ and $parent_{T_2}(f(d_2) = f(d)$. Hence $r$ is applicable in $f(d)$.
    \item If $r = u\rightarrow w\delta$, then $d\neq r_{T_1}$. Since $f$ is an isomorphism, then also $f(d)\neq r_{T_2}$. Other properties follows from the previous case.
    \item If $r = u\rightarrow [_k v]_k$, then $|V(T_1)|<L$. Isomorphism preserves number of nodes, hence $|V(T_2)| = |V(T_1)| < L$ and $r$ is applicable in $f(d)$. \qed
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

Now, we will define the encoding of a configuration $C = (T, l, c)$ into a tuple of integers.

A membrane $d\in T$ will be encoded as $(n+m)$-tuple $enc(d)\in\mathbb N^{(n+m)}$, where first $n$ numbers will be actual counts of objects and next $m$ numbers will encode the membrane label with $m-1$ zeros and one one:
\[
  enc(d)_{i} =
  \begin{cases}
    c(d)(a_i) & \text{if}\ i\leq n\\
    0 & \text{if}\ n<i\leq m\wedge i-n\neq l(d)\\
    1 & \text{if}\ n<i\leq m\wedge i-n=l(d)
  \end{cases}
\].

The entire tree will be encoded into concatenated sequences of encoded nodes in the preorder traversal order. This sequence is then padded with zeroes to have length $(n+m)L$ as that is the maximal length of encoded tree.

\begin{example}
  Suppose skin membrane with label 1 and contents $a_1^2a_2$ with a child membrane with label 2 and contents $a_2^2$. Then the encoding will be 21100201, where 2110 encodes the skin membrane and 0201 encodes the child membrane.
\end{example} 

Since there are only finitely many non-isomorphic trees with at most $L$ nodes (\cite{Cayley1881RootedTrees}), there is a constant $z$ such that we can uniquely assign the tree an order number $o(T) \leq z$.

The entire configuration will be encoded in tuple which consists of $z$ parts. All but the part with index $o(T)$ will contain just zeros. The part with index $o(T)$ will contain the encoding of the tree.

We will now show that comparing two encodings corresponds to covering of two configurations. Recall that configurations are encoded into tuples of integers, so the comparison is performed position by position.

\begin{lemma}
\label{encoding_lemma}
  For configurations $C_1 = (T_1, l_1, c_1)$ and $C_2 = (T_2, l_2, c_2)$, $enc(C_1) \leq enc(C_2)\Rightarrow C_1\leq C_2$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Both $enc(C_1)$ and $enc(C_2)$ contain $z$ parts and exactly one part which contains non-zero values. The non-zero part of $enc(C_1)$ must be non-zero also in $enc(C_2)$, because $enc(C_1)\leq enc(C_2)$. Then $o(T_1)=o(T_2)$, so the trees are isomorphic. Suppose there is an isomorphism $f:T_1\rightarrow T_2$. For every membrane $d\in T_1$, $l_1(d)=l_2(f(d))$ and $c_1(d)\subseteq c_2(f(d))$. Hence, $C_1\leq C_2$.
  \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{infinite_sequence_of_configurations_lemma}
  For sequential active P system with limit on the total number of membranes $L$ for every infinite sequence of configurations $\{C_i\}_{i=0}^\infty$ there is a pair $i<j$ such that $C_i\leq C_j$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose an infinite sequence $\{enc(C_i)\}_{i=0}^\infty$. We use a variation of Dickson's lemma (\cite{Figueira11Dickson}): Every infinite sequence of tuples from $\mathbb N^k$ contains an increasing pair. Applied to our sequence, there are two positions $i<j$ such that $enc(C_i)\leq enc(C_j)$. From lemma \ref{encoding_lemma}, $C_i\leq C_j$.
  \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  Existence of infinite computation for active P systems with limit on the total number of membranes is decidable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The algorithm for deciding the problem will traverse the reachability graph. When it encounters a configuration that covers another configuration, from lemma \ref{rule_applicability_lemma} follows that the same rules can be applied repeatedly, so the algorithm will halt with the answer YES.
  Otherwise, the algorithm will answer NO.
  Algorithm will always halt, because if there was an infinite computation, from lemma \ref{infinite_sequence_of_configurations_lemma} there would be two increasing configurations which is already covered in the YES case.
  \qed
\end{proof}

% subsection existence_of_infinite_computation (end)

\subsection{Existence of halting computation} % (fold)
\label{sub:existence_of_halting_computation}

In this subsection we will focus on the opposite problem: whether there is a computation that is halting. Recall that halting computation has no applicable rule in the last configuration.

The existence of halting configuration seems to be related to the language emptyness problem, which is undecidable. It is the problem to decide, if there is an input that is accepted by the P system. On the other hand, our variant of the halting problem is defined for a given input. It remains an open problem, whether there is a direct reduction between these two problems. If this is the case, the proof could be much simpler.

First, we will reduce this problem to the reachability problem. It is a problem of determining, for a given configuration $C$, whether there exists a computation from $C_0$ to $C$. Then, the reachability of active P systems can be then reduced to the reachabililty of register machines, which is undecidable.

For a given P system $\Pi$ and a target configuration $C$ we will construct a P system $\Pi^\prime$ such that there is a halting computation of $\Pi^\prime\Leftrightarrow\linebreak C$ is reachable for $\Pi$. Suppose $\Pi = (\Sigma, C_0, R_1, \dots, R_m)$ and $C = (T, l, c)$. Then we will construct $\Pi^\prime = (\Sigma^\prime, C_0^\prime, R_1^\prime, \dots, R_m^\prime)$, where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Sigma^\prime = \Sigma\cup\{\xi_d|d\in V(T)\}$,
  \item $C_0^\prime = (T, l, c^\prime)$, where $\forall d\in V(T)\setminus r_T: c^\prime(d) = c(d)$ and $c^\prime(r_T) = c(r_T)\cup\{\xi_{r_T}\}$,
  \item $\forall i\in\{1,\dots, m\}: R_i^\prime = R_i\cup\{\xi_d c(d)\rightarrow\xi_{d^\prime}\downarrow_{l(d^\prime)}|d,d^\prime\in V(T),l(d)=i,parent(d^\prime)=d\}$.
\end{itemize}

The $\xi_d$ objects are called verifiers, they are intended to verify if the contents of the membrane corresponds to the contents in the target configuration $C$. After this verification it descends down into child membranes for the verification of other parts of the membrane structure.
Initially, there is an object $\xi_{r_T}$ in the skin membrane. Verification is performed in the rule $\xi_d c(d)\rightarrow\xi_{d^\prime}\downarrow_{l(d^\prime)}$, where on the right side there is $\xi_{d^\prime}$ object for every child membrane $d^\prime$ in the target configuration $C$.

The construction is not complete. The system should not be able to halt unless the verification takes place. That is why we introduce a new object $\omega$ to each membrane with a rule $\omega\rightarrow\omega$ and the verifier will erase them with rule $\xi_d\omega c(d)\rightarrow\xi_{d^\prime}\downarrow_{l(d^\prime)}$. One application of this rule will erase the $\omega$ object and propagate proper $\xi$ object to every child membrane in the target configuration $C$. We also need to ensure that newly created membranes contain the $\omega$ object, so we replace every rule for membrane creation $u\rightarrow [_k v]_k$ with $u\rightarrow [_k v\omega]_k$.

There is still a problem. We actually check, whether a target configuration is contained within the current configuration. If there are additional objects which cannot be erased, so $C$ cannot be reached, we need to ensure $\Pi^\prime$ will not halt. We will add a rule $a\rightarrow a$ to each membrane for each object $a\in\Sigma$, so $\Pi^\prime$ can halt only if all objects are erased.

The last issue to solve is the dissolution. It is still possible that in the middle of the verifying, some of already verified membranes got dissolved and all yet unverified membranes will be successfully verified causing $\Pi^\prime$ to halt, although without that dissolution it would be unable to reach $C$. We need to ensure all dissolution happen before the verification takes place.
We will add a new object $\sigma$, which stands as a footprint object. It will be created as a result of the verification rule $\xi_d\omega c(d)\rightarrow\sigma\xi_{d^\prime}\downarrow_{l(d^\prime)}$. If a membrane is dissolved after it was verified, then two $\sigma$s will meet in the same membrane, because the parent membrane also contains $\sigma$ as it had been verified before. We will add a rule $\sigma\sigma\rightarrow\sigma\sigma$ to prevent $\Pi^\prime$ from halting.

The final construct is:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Sigma^\prime = \Sigma\cup\{\omega, \sigma\}\cup\{\xi_d|d\in V(T)\}$,
  \item $C_0^\prime = (T, l, c^\prime)$, where $\forall d\in V(T)\setminus r_T: c^\prime(d) = c(d)\cup\{\omega\}$ and $c^\prime(r_T) = c(r_T)\cup\{\omega,\xi_{r_T}\}$,
  \item $\forall i\in\{1,\dots, m\}: R_i^\prime = \{r|r\in R_i,r = u\rightarrow w\vee r = u\rightarrow w\delta\}\cup\linebreak\{u\rightarrow [_k v\omega]_k|u\rightarrow [_k v]_k\in R_i\}\cup\{a\rightarrow a|a\in\Sigma\}\cup\{\sigma\sigma\rightarrow\sigma\sigma,\omega\rightarrow\omega\}\cup\linebreak\{\xi_d\omega c(d)\rightarrow\sigma\xi_{d^\prime}\downarrow_{l(d^\prime)}|d,d^\prime\in V(T),l(d)=i,parent(d^\prime)=d\}$.
\end{itemize}

We can now state the main theorem.

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{existenceofhaltingtheorem}
\label{existence_of_halting_theorem}
  Existence of halting computation for active P systems with limit on the total number of membranes is undecidable.
\end{restatable}

We need to prove that $C$ is reachable for $\Pi$ if and only if there is a halting computation of $\Pi^\prime$. We need to prove two implications in order to formally prove correctness of this construction. The proof is quite technical and is present in the appendix.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have studied the termination problems for active sequential P systems. Unlike deterministic systems, the termination problems cannot be simply reduced to the halting problem. We have shown that active P systems with limit on the number of membranes have decidable existence of infinite computation and undecidable existence of halting computation. It is currently unknown whether the same results apply also for a variant without the limit on the number of membranes, so it could be a subject for the future study.

Regarding the open problem stated in \cite{Ibarra05Active} about sequential active P systems with hard membranes (without communication between membranes), it could be interesting to find a connection between the universality and decidability of these termination problems.
