\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% Bio motivation

Membrane systems (P systems) were introduced by P\u{a}un (see \cite{Paun2000108}) as distributed parallel computing devices inspired by the structure and functionality of cells.
One of the objectives is to relax the condition of using the rules in a maximally parallel way in order to find more realistic P systems from a biological point of view.
In sequential systems, only one rewriting rule is used in each step of computation.


\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

Here we recall several notions from the classical theory of formal languages.

An {\bf alphabet} is a finite nonempty set of symbols. Usually it is denoted by $\Sigma$ or $V$. A {\bf string} over an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from alphabet. We denote by $V^*$ the set of all strings over an alphabet $V$. By $V^+$ = $V^* - \{\eps\}$ we denote the set of all nonempty strings over V. A {\bf language} over the alphabet $V$ is any subset of $V^*$.

The number of occurrences of a given symbol $a\in V$ in the string $w\in V^*$ is denoted by $|w|_a$. $\Psi_V(w)=(|w|_{a_1},|w|_{a_2},\dots,|w|_{a_n})$ is called a Parikh vector associated with the string $w\in V^*$, where $V=\{a_1,a_2,\dots a_n\}$. For a language $L\subseteq V^*$, $\Psi_V(L)=\{\Psi_V(w)|w\in L\}$ is the Parikh mapping associated with $L$. If FL is a family of languages, PsFL is denoted the family of Parikh images of languages in FL.

A multiset over a set $X$ is a mapping $M: X\rightarrow \mathbb N$.
We denote by $M(x), x\in X$ the multiplicity of $x$ in the multiset $M$.
The {\bf support} of a multiset $M$ is the set $supp(M)=\{x\in X|M(x)\geq 1\}$.
It is the set of items with at least one occurrence.
A multiset is {\bf empty} when its support is empty.
A multiset $M$ with finite support $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ can be represented by the string $x_1^{M(x_1)}x_2^{M(x_2)}\dots x_n^{M(x_n)}$.
We say that multiset $M_1$ is included in multiset $M_2$ if $\forall x \in X: M_1(x)\leq M_2(x)$.
We denote it by $M_1\subseteq M_2$.
If $M_1\subseteq M_2$, the {\bf difference} of two multisets $M_2-M_1$ is defined as a multiset where $\forall x \in X: (M_2-M_1)(x)=\max(M_2(x)-M_1(x),0)$.
The {\bf union} of two multisets $M_1\cup M_2$ is a multiset where $\forall x \in X: (M_1\cup M_2)(x)=M_1(x)+M_2(x)$.
The product of multiset $M$ with natural number $n\in \mathbb N$ is a multiset where $\forall x \in X: (n\cdot M)(x)=n\cdot M(x)$.

Next, we recall notions from graph theory.

A {\bf rooted tree} is a tree, in which a particular node is distinguished from the others and called the root node.
Let $T$ be a rooted tree. We will denote its root node by $r_T$.
Let $t$ be a node of $T\setminus\{r_T\}$. The node adjacent to $t$ on the only path from $t$ to $r_T$ is called a {\bf parent node} of $t$ and is denoted by $parent(t)$.
We will denote the set of nodes of $T$ by $V(T)$ and set of its edges by $E(T)$.
Let $T_1, T_2$ be rooted trees. A bijection $f: V(T_1)\rightarrow V(T_2)$ is an {\bf isomorphism} only if $\{(f(u),f(v))|(u,v)\in E(V(T_1))\} = E(V(T_2))$. 

  
\section{Active P systems}
\label{sec:p systems}

% Membrane structure

The fundamental ingredient of a P system is the {\bf membrane structure} (see \cite{Paun2006Introduction}). It is a hierarchically arranged set of membranes, all contained in the {\bf skin membrane}. Each membrane determines a compartment, also called region, which is the space delimited from above by it and from below by the membranes placed directly inside, if any exists. Clearly, the correspondence membrane – region is one-to-one, that is why we sometimes use interchangeably these terms.
Membrane structure can be also viewed as a rooted tree with the skin membrane as the root node.

\label{sub:register_machines}
  As a referential universal language acceptor we will use Minsky's register machine. Such a machine runs a program consisting of numbered instructions of several simple types.
