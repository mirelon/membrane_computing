In previous chapter we introduced the notions of membrane and membrane structure.

% Place objects in the regions.

The next step is to place certain objects in the regions delimited by the membranes. The objects are identified by their names, mathematically symbols from a given alphabet.

% Multisets of objects.

Several copies of the same object can appear in a region, so we will work with multisets of objects.

% Evolution rules

In order to obtain a computing device, we will allow the objects to evolve according to evolution rules. Any object, alone or together with another objects, can be transformed in other objects, can pass through a membrane, and can dissolve the membrane in which it is placed.

% Parallelism

All objects evolve at the same time, in parallel manner across all membranes.

% Priorities

The evolution rules are hierarchized by a priority relation, which is a partial order.

% P system

These aspects all together forms a P system as introduced in \cite{Paun98}. An example of a P system containing rules for computing the Fibonacci sequence can be seen in the figure \ref{fig:p_system_fibonacci}.


In section~\ref{sec:definitions} we will provide formal definition of a P system.

Each rewriting rule may specify for each symbol on the right side, whether it stays in the current region, moves through the membrane to the parent region or through membrane to one of the child regions. An example of such rule is the following: $abb\rightarrow (a,here)(b,in)(c,out)(c,here)$.
