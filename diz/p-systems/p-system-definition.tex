{\em P system} is a tuple $(V, \mu, w_1, w_2,\dots , w_m, R_1, R_2, \dots , R_m)$, where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $V$ is the alphabet of symbols,
  \item $\mu$ is a membrane structure consisting of $m$ membranes labeled with numbers $1,2,\dots,m$,
  \item $w_1,w_2,\dots w_m$ are multisets of symbols present in the regions $1,2,\dots,m$ of the membrane structure,
  \item $R_1,R_2,\dots R_m$ are finite sets of rewriting rules associated with the regions $1,2,\dots,m$ of the membrane structure.
\end{itemize}
