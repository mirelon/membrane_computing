{\em ``In general, it seems that any extension which does not allow zero testing will not actually increase the modeling power (or decrease the decision power) of Petri nets but merely result in another equivalent formulation of the basic Petri net model. (Modeling convenience may be increased)''} \cite{Peterson81PetriNets}, page 203.

The above quote from \cite{Peterson81PetriNets} was a fair summary of current beliefs in the Petri net community regarding extensions of the basic Petri net mode: extensions are either Turing-powerful of they are not real extensions.

It is not the case as shown in \cite{Dufourd98Reset}. They show extensions of Petri nets which do not allow zero testing but that will actually increase the computational power and decrease the decision power (e.g. boundedness becomes undecidable).

In this chapter we investigate several ``weak'' extensions of sequential P systems, which allow for zero-testing, aiming to fit in layers between mere reformulations of the basic sequential P system and universal sequential P systems with inhibitors.

We will extend the definition of evolution rules with additional decision option for objects that are being sent through a membrane to another region. Recall the original definition of the evolution rule \ref{def:evolution_rule}: $u\rightarrow v$, where $u$ is a string over $\Sigma$ and $v=v^\prime$ or $v=v^\prime\delta$, where $v^\prime$ is a string over $\Sigma\times(\{here, out\}\cup\{in_j|1\leq j\leq m\})$ and $\delta$ is a special symbol not in $\Sigma$. Recall also the algorithm \ref{alg:application_of_a_rule_in_a_p_system}, which will be extended in following subsections.

\subsection{Objects avoiding empty regions} % (fold)
\label{sub:objects_avoiding_empty_regions}

We will have a specific subset of objects, which when occur in a rule in form of $(a, out)$ or $(a, in_j)$, and the target region is empty, they are not sent and stay in the current region instead.

\begin{definition}
  P system with objects avoiding empty regions is a tuple $$\Pi = (\Sigma, \Gamma, \mu, w_1, w_2,\ldots , w_m, R_1, R_2,\ldots , R_m),$$ where $$(\Sigma, \mu, w_1, w_2,\ldots , w_m, R_1, R_2,\ldots , R_m)$$ is a P system and $\Gamma\subseteq\Sigma$ is a subset of objects avoiding empty regions.
\end{definition}

We present an algorithm for the rule application \vpageref[below]{alg:application_of_a_rule_in_a_p_system_with_objects_avoiding_empty_regions} (algorithm \ref{alg:application_of_a_rule_in_a_p_system_with_objects_avoiding_empty_regions}).

\begin{example}
  Suppose a P system with objects avoiding empty regions $(\Sigma = \{a,b\}, \Gamma = \{a\}, \mu = [_1[_2]_2]_1, w_1 = a, w_2 = \eps, \\R_1 = \{a\rightarrow a\downarrow_2b\downarrow_2\}, R_2 = \{\})$.

  The computation starts with an empty region 2 and the object $a$ in the region 1. Application of the rule sends the object $b$ into the region 2 and the object $a$ stays in the current region because it is avoiding the empty region 2. In the next step, the application of the rule sends both objects into the region 2, because it already contains the object $b$. The computation finishes with objects $abb$ in the region 2 and empty region 1.
\end{example}

\subsection{Objects altering when entering empty region} % (fold)
\label{sub:objects_altering_when_entering_empty_region}

We represent altering the objects entering empty regions with a mapping $\Phi: \Sigma\rightarrow\Sigma$. The mapping defines for each object what it will become when sent to an empty region.

\begin{definition}
  P system with objects altering when entering empty region is a tuple $$\Pi = (\Sigma, \Phi, \mu, w_1, w_2,\ldots , w_m, R_1, R_2,\ldots , R_m),$$ where $$(\Sigma, \mu, w_1, w_2,\ldots , w_m, R_1, R_2,\ldots , R_m)$$ is a P system and $\Phi: \Sigma\rightarrow\Sigma$ is a mapping of objects.
\end{definition}

We present an algorithm for this variant of the rule application \vpageref[below]{alg:application_of_a_rule_in_a_p_system_with_objects_altering_when_entering_empty_region} (algorithm \ref{alg:application_of_a_rule_in_a_p_system_with_objects_altering_when_entering_empty_region}).

\begin{example}
  Suppose a P system with objects altering when entering empty region $(\Sigma = \{a,b\}, \Phi = \{a\rightarrow b, b\rightarrow b\}, \mu = [_1[_2]_2]_1, w_1 = a, w_2 = \eps, \\R_1 = \{a\rightarrow ba\downarrow_2, b\rightarrow a\downarrow_2\}, R_2 = \{\})$.

  The computation starts with an empty region 2 and the object $a$ in the region 1. Application of the rule $a\rightarrow ba\downarrow_2$ produces an object $b$ which stays in the current region and the second product $a$ is sent into the region 2, which is empty, so the produced $a$ is altered to $b$. Now both regions contains an object $b$. In the next step, the application of the rule $b\rightarrow a\downarrow_2$ in region 1 sends the produced object $a$ into the region 2, but this time it is not altered because the region is nonempty. The computation finishes with objects $ab$ in the region 2 and empty region 1.
\end{example}

\subsection{Concluding remarks} % (fold)
\label{sub:concluding_remarks_of_emptyness_detection}

The above presented variants show possible implementations of zero-check by the feature of emptyness detection which is a specific notion for membrane systems. The aim of the research was to find a variant with zero-check that will not lead to computational completeness and will possibly reveal some unexpected connection with other models of computation. Sequential P systems with objects altering when entering empty region (subsection \ref{sub:objects_altering_when_entering_empty_region}) and sequential P systems with vacuum objects (subsection \ref{sub:vacuum_objects}) are universal because we can simulate a register machine. On the other hand, the other variant with objects avoiding empty regions (subsection \ref{sub:objects_avoiding_empty_regions}) appears to be more promising for our goal because the standard contruction of register machine do not work. We conjecture this variant is not universal, possibly equivalent with Petri nets or other model of computation weaker than Turing machine.
