In this chapter we propose various modifications of sequential P systems and study their effect on computing power and decidability of behavioral properties.

We have presented the current state of the research of the P system variants. Especially the parallelism options have been investigated very well, but there are still some gaps that should be filled. For many variants the universality has been proven only when working in the maximally parallel mode. In most cases the sequential mode is strictly weaker, but this is not always true.

We have studied several variants of sequential P systems in order to obtain universality without using maximal parallelism.
