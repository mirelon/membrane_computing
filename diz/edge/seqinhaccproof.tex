  Sequential P systems with cooperative rules and inhibitors can simulate register machines and thus equal $PsRE$.

\label{proof:reg_by_inh}
  Suppose we have an $n$-register machine $M = (n,P,i,h)$. In our simulation we will have a membrane structure consisting of single membrane and the contents of register $j$ will be represented by the multiplicity of the object $a_j$.

  We will simulate the register machine by P system $(\Sigma, \mu, w, R)$, where:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\Sigma$ is an alphabet consisting of symbols that represent registers $a_1,\dots a_n$, instruction labels from the register machine $M$ and a halting symbol $\#$,
    \item $\mu$ is a membrane structure consisting of one single membrane,
    \item $w$ is initial contents of the membrane. It contains symbols for the input for the machine $a_i^{n_i}$ where $n_i$ is initial state of register with label $i$ and initial instruction label $e$.
    \item $R$ is a set of rules in the skin membrane.
  \end{itemize}
    
  For all instructions of type $(e : add(j), k, l)$ we will have rules:
  \begin{align*}
    e \rightarrow a_j|k\\
    e \rightarrow a_j|l.
  \end{align*}

  For all instructions of type $(e : sub(j), k, l)$ we will have rules:
  \begin{align*}
    e|a_j \rightarrow k\\
    e \rightarrow l|_{\neg a_j}.
  \end{align*}

  And finally halting rules:
  \begin{align*}
    h|a_j \rightarrow h|\#\text{~for all~}a\leq j\leq n,\\
    \# \rightarrow \#.
  \end{align*}

  For a configuration $(j, m_1, \dots, m_n)$ of the simulated register machine $M$ the skin membrane of the simulating P system contains a symbol $j$ and objects representing contents of registers $a_1^{m_1}, \dots, a_n^{m_n}$.

  When the halting instruction is reached, if there is an object present in the membrane, the hash symbol $\#$ is created and the rule $\# \rightarrow \#$ will be applicable forever as there is no rule to remove the symbol $\#$. If there is no object present, there is no rule to apply and computation will halt. It corresponds to the condition that all registers should be empty when halting. \qed
