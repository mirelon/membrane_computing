\index{P systems!sequential} A sequential variant without priorities and with cooperative rules is not universal (see \cite{Ibarra04dang}). They have tried modifying the variant to increase the computational power and showed that with rules for membrane creation with unbounded number of membranes it became universal.

We have tried another approach using rules with inhibitors. This variant is computationally complete in both generating and accepting case. For the generative case we present a proof by a simulation of maximal parallel P system and in the accepting case we prove it can simulate a register machine.

Original definition of \index{P systems!with inhibitors} P systems with inhibitors (see \cite{Ionescu:jucs_10_5:on_p_systems_with}) allow to use only one inhibitor per rule, e.g. $u\rightarrow v|_{\neg i}$. Alternative definition (see \cite{Agrigoroaiei:2010:Dissolution}) allow to use whole inhibitor set in the rule like $u\rightarrow v|_{\neg B}$, where $B$ is a set of objects. Such a rule can be applied only if no element of $B$ is present in the region.

For sequential P systems, the following lemma will show the equivalence of these definitions for our setting. However, a special condition must be fulfilled, the regions with such rules cannot be empty.

We have also reached this result in the accepting case by simulation of \index{Register machine} register machines.

\subsection{Concluding remarks} % (fold)
\label{sub:concluding_remarks_of_inhibitors}

Although these results are not very surprising as similar results already hold for Petri nets, which are equivalent to sequential P systems, the simulation of maximal parallel P system used in the proof for generating case is valuable not only for the universality, but also can be seen as a method of conversion between P systems in sequential manner and maximally parallel manner, which may be essential for future works on P systems and other multiset rewriting systems. Sequential variants are promising alternative to traditional maximal parallel variants and will be good subject for the further research. Future plans include research of other more restricted variants such as omitting cooperation in the rules or restricting the power of inhibitors.
