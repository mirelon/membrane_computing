A sequential variant without priorities and with cooperative rules is not universal (see \cite{Ibarra04dang}). They have tried modifying the variant to increase the computational power and showed that with rules for membrane creation with unbounded number of membranes it became universal.

We have tried another approach using rules with inhibitors. This variant is computationally complete in both generating and accepting case. For the generative case we present a proof by a simulation of maximal parallel P system and in the accepting case we prove it can simulate a register machine.

Original definition of P systems with inhibitors (see \cite{Ionescu:jucs_10_5:on_p_systems_with}) allow to use only one inhibitor per rule, e.g. $u\rightarrow v|_{\neg i}$. Alternative definition (see \cite{Agrigoroaiei:2010:Dissolution}) allow to use whole inhibitor set in the rule like $u\rightarrow v|_{\neg B}$, where $B$ is a set of objects. Such a rule can be applied only if no element of $B$ is present in the region.

For sequential P systems, the following lemma will show the equivalence of these definitions for our setting. However, a special condition must be fulfilled, the regions with such rules cannot be empty.

We have also reached this result in the accepting case by simulation of register machines.

Future plans include research other more restricted variants such as omitting cooperation in the rules or restrict the power of inhibitors.
