Besozzi in his PhD thesis (see \cite{Besozzi:PhD:2004}) formulates three criteria that a good P system variant should satisfy:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item It should be as much realistic as possible from the biological point of view, in order not to widen the distance between the inspiring cellular reality and the idealized theory.
	\item It should result in computational completeness and efficiency, which would mean to obtain universal (and hence, programmable) computing devices, with a powerful and useful intrinsic parallelism;
	\item It should present mathematical minimality and elegance, to the aim of proposing an alternative framework for the analysis of computational models.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Accepting vs generating} % (fold)
\label{sub:accepting_vs_generating}

In the Chomsky hierarchy, there are language acceptors (finite automata, Turing machines) and language generators (formal grammars).

% Accepting grammars

Bordhin in \cite{Bordihn99acceptingpure} extends grammars to allow for accepting languages by interchanging the left side with the right side of a rule. The mode will apply rewriting rules to an input word and accept it when it reaches the starting nonterminal. However, the input word consists of terminal symbols, which could not be rewritten when using original definition, hence they consider the pure version of various grammar types where they give up the distinction between terminal and nonterminal symbols.

% Accepting vs generating common results

The regular, context-free, context-sensitive and recursively enumerable languages were shown to have equal power in accepting and generating mode.
Some other grammars (programmed grammars with appearence checking) are shown to be more powerful in accepting mode than in generating mode.
For deterministic Lindenmeyer systems, the generating and accepting mode are incomparable.

% Accepting vs generating P system results

It can be interesting to investigate accepting and generating mode also in P system variants. Barbuti in \cite{Barbuti:2010:AcceptingGenerating} shown that in the nondeterministic case, when either promoters or cooperative rules are allowed, acceptor P systems have shown to be universal. The same in known to hold for the corresponding classes of nondeterministic generator P systems. In the deterministic case, acceptor P systems have been shown to be universal only if cooperative rules are allowed. Universality has been shown not to hold for the corresponding classes of generator P systems.

\subsection{Active vs passive membranes} % (fold)
\label{sub:active_vs_passive_membranes}

% TODO: need citations
Most of the studied P system variants assumes that the number of membranes can only decrease during a computation, by dissolving membranes as a result of applying evolution rules to the objects present in the system.
A natural possibility is to let the number of membranes also to increase during a computation, for instance, by division, as it is well-known in biology. Actually, the membranes from biochemistry are not at all passive, like those in the models briefly described above.
For example, the passing of a chemical compound through a membrane is often done by a direct interaction with the membrane itself (with the so-called protein channels or protein gates present in the membrane); during this interaction, the chemical compound which passes through membrane can be modified, while the membrane itself can in this way be modified (at least locally).

In \cite{Paun99ActiveMembranes} Paun considers P systems with active membranes where the central role in the computation is played by the membranes: evolution rules are associated both with objects and membranes, while the communication through membranes is performed with the direct participation of the membranes; moreover, the membranes can not only be dissolved, but they also can multiply by division. An elementary membrane can be divided by means of an interaction with an object from that membrane.

% Polarisation

Each membrane is supposed to have an electrical polarization (we will say charge), one of the three possible: positive, negative, or neutral. If in a membrane we have two immediately lower membranes of opposite polarizations, one positive and one negative, then that membrane can also divide in such a way that the two membranes of opposite charge are separated; all membranes of neutral charge and all objects are duplicated and a copy of each of them is introduced in each of the two new membranes.
The skin is never divided.
If at the same time a membrane is divided and there are objects in this membrane which are being rewritten in the same step, then in the new copies of the membrane the result of the evolution is included.

In this way, the number of membranes can grow, even exponentially. As expected, by making use of this increased parallelism we can compute faster.
For example, the SAT problem, which is NP complete, can be solved in linear time, when we consider the steps of computation as the time units.
Moreover, the model is shown to be computationally universal.

\subsection{Rules with priorities} % (fold)
\label{sub:rules_with_priorities}

In the original definition of a P system \cite{Paun98}, a partial order relation over set of rewriting rules have been specified. The rule can be used only if no rule of a higher priority in the region can be applied at the same time.

Sos\'ik in \cite{Sosik:2002:WithoutPriorities} showed that the priorities may be omitted from the model without loss of computational power.

\subsection{Energy in P systems} % (fold)
\label{sub:energy_in_p_systems}

Various notions of energy has been proposed for use in P systems. Paun in \cite{Paun:2001:Energy} considers a P system where each evolution rule ``produces'' or ``consumes'' some quantity of energy, in amounts which are expressed as integer numbers. In each moment and in each membrane the total energy involved in an evolution step should be positive, but if ``Soo much'' energy is present in a membrane, then the membrane will be destroyed (dissolved). This variant was investigated in two cases, both were shown to be universal:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item when using only two membranes and unbounded amount of energy,
	\item when using arbitrarily many membranes and a bounded energy associated with rules
\end{enumerate}

Freund in \cite{Freund:2004:SequentialEnergy} introduced a new variant where the rules are assigned directly to membranes (every rule consume objects on one side of the membrane and produce objects on the other side) and every membrane carries an energy value that can be changed during a computation by objects passing through the membrane.

This variant is universal even in sequential mode if we allow priorities on the objects. When omitting the priority relation, only the family of Parikh sets generated by context-free matrix grammars is obtained.
