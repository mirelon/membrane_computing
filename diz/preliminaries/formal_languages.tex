Our study is based on the classical theory of formal languages. We will recall some definitions:

\begin{definition}
An {\bf alphabet} is a finite nonempty set of symbols.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A {\bf string} over an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from alphabet.
\end{definition}

The length of the string $s$ is denoted by $|s|$. We denote by $V^*$ the set of all strings over an alphabet $V$. By $V^+$ = $V^* - \{\eps\}$ we denote the set of all nonempty strings over V.

\begin{definition}
A {\bf language} over the alphabet $V$ is any subset of $V^*$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A {\bf family of languages} is a set of languages.
\end{definition}
