\section{Formal languages theory} % (fold)
\label{sec:formal_languages_theory}

Our study is based on the classical theory of formal languages. We will recall some definitions:

\begin{definition}
An {\bf alphabet} is a finite nonempty set of symbols. Usually it is denoted by $\Sigma$ or $V$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A {\bf string} over an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from alphabet.
\end{definition}

We denote by $V^*$ the set of all strings over an alphabet $V$. By $V^+$ = $V^* - \{\eps\}$ we denote the set of all nonempty strings over V.

\begin{definition}
A {\bf language} over the alphabet $V$ is any subset of $V^*$.
\end{definition}

\section{Multisets} % (fold)
\label{sec:multisets}

\begin{definition}
A multiset over a set $X$ is a mapping $M: X\rightarrow \mathbb N$.
\end{definition}

We denote by $M(x), x\in X$ the multiplicity of $x$ in the multiset $M$.

\begin{definition}
The {\bf support} of a multiset $M$ is the set $supp(M)=\{x\in X|M(x)\geq 1\}$.
\end{definition}

It is the set of items with at least one occurence.

\begin{definition}
A multiset is {\bf empty} when it's support is empty.
\end{definition}

A multiset $M$ with finite support $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ can be represented by the string $x_1^{M(x_1)}x_2^{M(x_2)}\dots x_n^{M(x_n)}$.

\begin{definition}
Multiset inclusion. We say that mutiset $M_1$ is included in multiset $M_2$ if $M_1(x)\leq M_2(x)\forall x \in X$. We denote it by $M_1\subseteq M_2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
The {\bf union} of two multisets $M_1\cup M_2 : X\rightarrow \mathbb N$ is defined as $(M_1\cup M_2)(x)=M_1(x)+M_2(x)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
The {\bf difference} of two multisets $M_1-M_2 : X\rightarrow \mathbb N$ is defined as $(M_1-M_2)(x)=M_1(x)-M_2(x)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Product of multiset $M$ with natural number $n\in \mathbb N$ is $(n\cdot M)(x)=n\cdot M(x)$.  
\end{definition}

\section{Multiset languages} % (fold)
\label{sec:multiset_languages}

The number of occurences of a given symbol $a\in V$ in the string $w\in V^*$ is denoted by $|w|_a$.

\begin{definition}
$\Psi_V(w)=(|w|_{a_1},|w|_{a_2},\dots,|w|_{a_n})$ is called a Parikh vector associated with the string $w\in V^*$, where $V=\{a_1,a_2,\dots a_n\}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
For a language $L\subseteq V^*$, $\Psi_V(L)=\{\Psi_V(w)|w\in L\}$ is the Parikh mapping associated with $V$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Consider an alphabet $V=\{a,b\}$ and a language $L=\{a, ab, ba\}$.
$\Psi_V(L)=\{(1,0), (1,1)\}$. Notice that Parikh image of $L$ has only 2 element while $L$ has 3 elements.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
If FL is a family of languages, by PsFL is denoted the family of Parikh images of languages in FL.
\end{definition}

\section{Lindenmeyer systems} % (fold)
\label{sec:lindenmeyer_systems}

In 1968, a Hungarian botanist and theoretical biologist Aristid Lindenmeyer introduced \cite{Lindenmeyer68} a new string rewriting algorithm named Lindenmeyer systems (or L-systems for short). They are used by biologists and theoretical computer scientists to mathematically model growth processes of living organisms, especially plants. The difference with Chomsky grammars is that rewriting is parallel, not sequential.

The simplest version of L-systems assumes that the development of a cell is free of influence of other cells.
This type of L-systems is called $0L$ systems, where ``0'' stands for zero-sided communication between cells.

\begin{definition}
$0L$ system is a triple $(\Sigma, P, \omega)$, where $\Sigma$ is an alphabet, $\omega$ is a word over $\Sigma$ and $P$ is a finite set of rewriting rules of the form $a\rightarrow x$, where $a\in\Sigma, x\in\Sigma^*$.
\end{definition}

It is assumed there is at least one rewriting rule for each letter of $\Sigma$. $0L$ system works in parallel way, so all the symbols are rewritten in each step.

\begin{example}
Consider the $0L$ system with alphabet $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$, initial word $\omega = a$ and rewriting rules $P = \{a\rightarrow b, b\rightarrow ab\}$.
Since in this system there is exactly one rule for every letter of the alphabet, the rewriting is deterministic and the generated words will be $\{a, b, ab, bab, abbab, \dots \}$. 
\end{example}

$1L$ systems allows the rewriting rules to include context of size 1, so it allows for rules of type $yaz\rightarrow x$.

L-systems with tables ($T$) have several sets of rewriting rules instead of just one set. At one step of the rewriting process, rules belonging to the same set have to be applied. The biological motivation for introducing tables is that one may want different rules to take care of different environmental conditions (heat, light, etc.) or of different stages of development.

\begin{definition}
An extended ($E0L$) system is a pair $G_1 = (G, \Sigma_T)$, where $G = (\Sigma, P, \omega)$ is an $0L$ system, where $\Sigma_T \subseteq \Sigma$, referred to as the terminal alphabet. The language generated by $G_1$ is defined by $L(G_1) = L(G)\cap \Sigma_T^*$.
\end{definition}

Such languages are called $E0L$ languages. $E0L$ languages with tables are called $ET0L$ languages.
