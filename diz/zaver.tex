We have studied several variants of sequential P systems in order to obtain universality without using maximal parallelism. A variant with rewriting rules that can use inhibitors was shown to be universal in both generating and accepting case. The generating model is able to simulate maximal parallel P system and the accepting model can simulate a register machine.
The constructive proof for the generating case is valuable not only for the universality, but also can be seen as a method of conversion between P systems in sequential manner and maximally parallel manner, which may be essential for future works on P systems and other multiset rewriting systems. Sequential variants are promising alternative to traditional maximal parallel variants and will be good subject for the further research. Future plans include research of other more restricted variants such as omitting cooperation in the rules or restricting the power of inhibitors.

In addition, we have defined a new variants of zero-testing, aiming to fit in layers between mere reformulations of the basic sequential P system and universal sequential P systems with inhibitors. These include various forms of detection of empty membranes, which is specific for membrane systems. As for now, the work is currently in progress, and the results obtained so far have been just the computational completeness. However, one variant with objects avoiding empty regions is more promising for our goal because the standard contruction of register machine do not work. We conjecture this variant is not universal, possibly equivalent with Petri nets.

There are many features not yet combined, so we suggest them for the further research (non-cooperative rules, rules with priorities, decaying objects, deterministic steps, \ldots).

Aside from the research of the computational power, we have investigated the decidability problems of existence of (in)finite computation for a universal class of P systems with active membranes. We have shown and published our results that are on both sides of the decidability barrier. Regarding the open problem stated in \cite{Ibarra05Active} about sequential active P systems with hard membranes (without communication between membranes), it could be interesting to find a connection between the universality and decidability of these termination problems.

We research sequential P systems with active membranes also in combination with notions inspired by reaction systems, i.e. using sets instead of multisets and the assumption of non-permanency of objects. There are no results yet in this area and our proposals could be set as a single topic for the future study.
